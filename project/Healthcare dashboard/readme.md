Healthcare Dashboard for Executive Decision-Making

Project Lead: Xinyi (Annie) Luo 



Date: February – April 2025 

📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project was to design and construct a comprehensive healthcare dashboard to facilitate executive decision-making within a hospital setting. By integrating clinical and operational data, the dashboard provides healthcare leaders with a clear, interactive interface to interpret current hospital performance and drive strategic improvements.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 


Libraries: Plotly, Matplotlib 


Database Management: SQL 


Data Processing: Excel 


Design/Architecture: draw.io 

📊 Data Pipeline & Development

System Design: Utilized draw.io to map out the dashboard architecture and user flow for executive stakeholders.


Data Acquisition: Extracted and generated datasets tailored to hospital performance metrics.

ETL Process:

Applied Excel for initial data inspection and preliminary formatting.

Utilized SQL to clean, filter, and load the datasets into the analysis environment, ensuring data integrity for medical reporting.


Visualization: Built an interactive interface using Plotly and Matplotlib to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as patient volume, resource allocation, and clinical outcomes.

💡 Key Features & Impact

Executive Insights: Developed specialized views that allow leaders to interpret hospital performance at a glance.


Interactive Functionality: Leveraged Python libraries to enable filtering and drill-down capabilities, allowing users to move from high-level summaries to specific data points.


Clean Data Architecture: Demonstrated the ability to manage the full data lifecycle from raw Excel/SQL sources to a refined visualization tool.
